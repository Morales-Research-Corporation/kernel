# Sun Kernel v5.10.6 (Stable)
There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

## Sun Kernel (based on Linux)
The Sun Kernel is based on Linux to provide the most prominent features to the end user, and new technologies within the kernel, for example, livepatching, which patches your system while running without needing a reboot.
We will soon be adding support for ZFS on the kernel and for Sun/OS!

We expect to release the Sun kernel v5.11 by April or June of 2021!
